            <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle. In prehistoric times, humans hunted aurochs and later
                domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the
                quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world</p>

            <h2 class="chicken chicken-bg">Chicken</h2>
            <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world (The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms). Owing to the relative ease and low cost of
                raising chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have
                become prevalent in numerous cuisines.</p>
